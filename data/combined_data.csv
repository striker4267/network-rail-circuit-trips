No fault found,BW-13 tripped on 13/08/20 at 17.04  the Up Fast 7.5km from Whitmore  and would not reset. Patrolled from G141/12 to Norton Bridge which included the distance to fault.  No damage to the OHL was found so the decision was made to test the circuit breaker in question by opening BW-13/1F feeder switch.  This proved the breaker was at fault as it still tripped.  BW-13 was then powered from a single point which is WU/BW-13 while maintaining BW-13/1F at open.  The OHL was cleared for use ]

Foreign object,Spoke to the signaller who reported the flash who told us it was around the overbridge at M182 17A we had a look around this area everything looked mechanically fine and nothing which could come in contact with the ole and cause a trip. What we did find is a big deflated balloon caught in the bushes near by. Also this is bridge seems to have a high number of things thrown off it we found clothes cans plastic tape balloons balls cans to name a few my guess would be debris thrown from the bridge]

Water ingress,"Patrolled south end of Kilsby tunnel where flash/bang was reported. All insulators in the tunnel were visibly/audibly arcing and buzzing from the extreme moisture in the tunnel, which could account for the trip and driver sighting. Informed Fault control and they were satisfied. Photos attached are illustrative of all insulators encountered. ]"
