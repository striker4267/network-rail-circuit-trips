Spoke to the signaller who reported the flash who told us it was around the overbridge at M182 17A we had a look around this area everything looked mechanically fine and nothing which could come in contact with the ole and cause a trip. What we did find is a big deflated balloon caught in the bushes near by. Also this is bridge seems to have a high number of things thrown off it we found clothes cans plastic tape balloons balls cans to name a few my guess would be debris thrown from the bridge]
Spoke to the signaller who reported the flash who told us it was around the overbridge at M182 17A we had a look around this area everything looked mechanically fine and nothing which could come in contact with the ole and cause a trip. What we did find is a big deflated balloon caught in the bushes near by. Also this is bridge seems to have a high number of things thrown off it we found clothes cans plastic tape balloons balls cans to name a few my guess would be debris thrown from the bridge]
